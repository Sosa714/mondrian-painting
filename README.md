# mondrian-painting


Welcome to the "Mondrian Painting"! In this creative project, I recreated a work inspired by Piet Mondrian using CSS Grid. The goal was to replicate the iconic Mondrian-style grid painting while adhering to precise dimensions and color schemes.

## Project Overview

- **Title**: Mondrian Painting
- **Objective**: Recreate a Mondrian-style painting using CSS Grid.

### HTML Structure

The project's HTML structure consists of a grid container with various grid items. Each item represents a colored block in the Mondrian painting:

- **`.container`**: This grid container serves as the canvas for the painting, maintaining a fixed height and width (748px by 748px).

- **`.item`**: These grid items represent individual blocks within the painting. They are filled with colors as per the Mondrian style.

### CSS Styling

- **Grid Layout**: The CSS Grid is used to create the precise layout of the painting. The grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties define the dimensions of columns and rows, while gap property sets the gap between items.

- **Color Blocks**: Each `.item` class is styled with a specific background color to match the Mondrian painting's color scheme. The Mondrian colors used are:
  - Red: #E72F24
  - White: #F0F1EC
  - Black: #232629
  - Blue: #004592
  - Yellow: #F9D01E

- **Positioning**: The Mondrian painting's specific structure is achieved by defining the grid placement of various `.item` elements, replicating the geometric patterns and color divisions seen in Mondrian's work.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the HTML and CSS files to see how the Mondrian-style painting was recreated using CSS Grid. This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of CSS Grid for creating complex layouts and designs.

Enjoy the artistic rendition of the Mondrian style within a CSS Grid canvas!
